# This is README file for the EX-1

## These are the tasks that I've completed:

1. Understand the initial code in `server.js`.
2. Create the following folders:
   - `controllers/`
   - `routes/`
   - `models/`
   - `middleware/`
3. Refactor the code based on the roles of each part:
   - Move request logic to `controllers/`
   - Move route definitions to `routes/`
   - Move user data management to `models/`
   - Add a logging middleware to `middleware/`
4. Ensure the `server.js` file only contains server setup and middleware registration.
5. Maintain consistent naming and structure as described below.
